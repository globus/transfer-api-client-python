Demonstrate how to use the delegate_proxy activation method. Note that this
method requires either M2Crypto or a custom C program called mkproxy, available from the project github (but not currently included in the PyPI package).

To install M2Crypto in Fedora/RHEL/CentOS:

 $ yum install m2crypto

In Ubuntu/Debian:

 $ apt-get install python-m2crypto

It can also be installed with easy_install/pip etc, if the Python and openssl
headers are available:

 $ easy_install m2crypto


For documentation on mkproxy, see the mkproxy subdirectory on github:
 https://github.com/globusonline/transfer-api-client-python


Usage:

 delegate_proxy_activate.py USERNAME 'ENDPOINT_NAME' /path/to/credential \
    -k /path/to/auth/key -c /path/to/auth/cert

The credential passed as the third argument is what is used to activate the
endpoint, and may be the same or different from the credential used to
authenticate to the API (passed with -k/-c).

The endpoint name may contain a # which is a shell comment, so be sure to
quote the endpoint name.
